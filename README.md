# UMDDC21

Ha....this brings back memories tooo..


This repository contains the work we did for The UMD Data Challenge. Me and Apurva Dixit paired up because we were the duds of the class(Sorry Apurva) and everyone else took all the smart ones

We worked on the packaged meals dataset and this is the first time I used R in the real world. Hopefully I don't have to use it again


I worked on the wrangling of the data and Apurva worked on the visualizations. We did get the interest of the client (USDA), maybe because everyone else picked cooler datasets like COVID-19 and I was hungry when we picked the datasets

Unfortunately we weren't able to convert that to our Summer Internship because we weren't eligible for CPT during that time and hence interest fizzled out for when we were. :(
